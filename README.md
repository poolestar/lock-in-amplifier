# Lock-In-Amplifier

This public personal repository was sourced from the VIPM lock-in amplifier plus a few debugging/learning subVIs. This repo include changes like: adding 2 mathematically generated sines from the FPGA for validation purpuses, adding a PLL better suited for digital pulses, and adding a FIR decimation filter as well as the including CIC.

## Software Stack

The development enviroment for this reference architecture is made of:

- LabVIEW 32 bits 2017
- LabVIEW FPGA Module 2017
- FlexRIO Driver 2018
- NI-FGEN 2018

These software version are not mandatory. I'm just documenting the one used during development in case a 1:1 system needs to be setup for debugging.
